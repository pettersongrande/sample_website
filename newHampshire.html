                                Crotched Mountain is out-of-this-world day or night. From first tracks with 1000' of vertical to shredding under the stars with night skiing and riding, we've got enough adventure to keep you out all day and night. Home to the Rocket high speed quad and Midnight Madness, there's no place on Earth like Crotched.
